# DataGenerationSimulator
1. Data generating simulator (main_generate.py)
2. Data checker (main_chk.py)
## Motivation: 
The python scripts were developed for the need of work. (especially GK-2A satellite)
## Purpose:
Generate incoming files to simulate the environment of satellite data receiving host or radar data receiving host, etc. 
## Advantages:
1. Separate the executable python scripts and setting files *.ini. 
## Setting of ini files: 
1. Please see Design.txt and example ini files. 
## Future works: 
1. Make an UI for configuring setting files.(in c# maybe)
2. Auto compress and archive functions.
