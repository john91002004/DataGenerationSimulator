# DataGenerationSimulator
This is a python script that generates files automatically to simulate periodically incoming file receiving host such as satellite data receiver, radar data receiver. 
## Motivation: 
The python scripts were developed for the need of work. 
## Purpose:
Generate incoming files to simulate the environment of satellite data receiving host or radar data receiving host, etc. 
## Advantages:
